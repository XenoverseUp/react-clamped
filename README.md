## Install

npm install --save react-clamped
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Just import the Clamped component and wrap your content inside. The line number can be adjusted with clamp prop. The default for clamp prop is "1".

```tsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'

import { Clamped } from 'react-clamped'

class Card extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="card">
        <Clamped clamp={4}>{...your multiline content...}</Clamped>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

### useClamped Hook

You can truncate the lines to a fixed number with useClamped hook, as well. Import the hook and initialize. Then assign the ref to the element you want to truncate.


```tsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'

import { useClamped } from 'react-clamped'

const Card = () => {
  const ref = useClamped({
    clamp: 3,
    isClamped: true
  })
  
  return (
      <div className="card">
        <p ref={ref}>{...your multiline content...}</p>
      </div>
    )
}
```

### Props

- clamp : Number
    This prop determines how many lines should be rendered. The "**clamp**" can be used in both "Clamped" component as a prop and in "useClamped" hook as an object entry. Default value is **1**.
- element : String
    The "**element**" prop can be used in only "Clamped" component as a prop and it determines which DOM element should be used to wrap content. Default value is **"p"**.
- isClamped : Boolean
    This prop determines if the text should be truncated. The "**isClamped**" can be used in both "Clamped" component as a prop and in "useClamped" hook as an object entry. This prop can be very handy if you want to make a "show more" button. The default value if **true**.
